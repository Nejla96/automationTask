The idea of the project is that we export four interfaces IButton, IElement, IExecutionTool, IField. TypeScript and JavaScript were used, and this is the structure:

BaseCompontent:
interface -  IButton, IElement, IExecutionTool, IField
Button -  The Button class then implements the IButton, IField, and IElement interfaces
EHSFramework -  EHSFramework class implements the IExecutionTool

data - is used for data entry

page objects:
EHSAllItems - contains elements and actions for EHS All Items screen
EHSHome - contains elements and actions for EHS Home screen
EHSItem - contains elements and actions for EHS Item screen

states/appStates - contains startEHSApplication and exitEHSApplication methods

tasks/uiTasks - use all high level methods called in spec

test-suites/testSpec - contain spec we "run"
